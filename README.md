In the Ptidej Team (Pattern Trace Identification, Detection, and Enhancement in Java1), we aim at developing theories, methods, and tools, to evaluate and to improve the quality of object-oriented programs by promoting the use of idioms, design patterns, and architectural patterns. We want to formalise patterns, to identify occurrences of patterns, and to improve the identified occurrences. We also want to evaluate experimentally the impact of patterns on the quality of object-oriented programs. We develop various tools, most notably the Ptidej tool suite and Taupe, to evaluate and to enhance the quality of object-oriented programs, promoting the use of patterns, either at the language-, design-, or architectural-levels.
